# JUnit5-Testing-Showcase
## Introduction
Welcome to my JUnit5 Testing Showcase! This repository demonstrates the skills and knowledge I gained from the Udemy course "[Practical Java Unit Testing with JUnit 5](https://www.udemy.com/course/junit5-for-beginners/)." It serves as a portfolio of test cases and scenarios, reflecting best practices in unit testing with JUnit 5. The repository is especially relevant as I prepare for my internship at Nasdaq-Verafin, where I'll be applying these skills.


## What's Inside
- **BMICalculatorTest.java**: A series of unit tests for a BMI calculator application.
- **DietPlannerTest.java**: Tests for a diet planning tool, showcasing various test scenarios.
These files exemplify how to write effective and practical unit tests in JUnit 5. They include examples of basic Test Driven Development (TDD) and demonstrate how to create real-world test scenarios.
- **ApartmentRaterTest.java**: A series of unit tests for the Real Estate application.
- - **RandomApartmentGeneratorTest.java**: A series of unit tests for the Real Estate application.

## Setup and Running Tests
These tests were made using:
- Java JDK (version 8 or higher)
- An IDE with JUnit 5 support (like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA)
